"""
A template for creating a PySide6 application with an OpenGL viewport using py-ngl.

This script sets up a basic window, initializes an OpenGL context, and provides
standard mouse and keyboard controls for interacting with a 3D scene (rotate, pan, zoom).
It is designed to be a starting point for more complex OpenGL applications.
