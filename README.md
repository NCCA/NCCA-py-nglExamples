# Py-NGL Demos

This is work in progress examples for the new all python version of the NGL library.

Whilst I will mainly be using WebGP for my teaching I thought It would be good to also have an OpenGL example for quick demos and easier coding in some cases.

The Py-NGL library is being developed at the same time as this at present but will be on PyPi once everything is fully developed and I will document it all properly then.
